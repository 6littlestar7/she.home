             Sheros is a team for women by women to help all the ladies out there. <i/><h3/>
            <live><i><br> Sheros has been working in India for 70 years, focusing on women empowerment and social exclusion. We do this through well-planned and comprehensive programmes in health, education, livelihoods and disaster preparedness and response. Sheros is collaborating with development partners in fighting COVID-19 health crisis. We are helping frontline female workers stay safe with PPE, distributing dry rations to feed the needy, raising awareness in our programme areas.
                <br>355 million is the number of menstruating women in India, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of the countryâ€™s population. Menstruation continues to be a subject of gender disparity in India.
                <br>We provide sanitary pads to women who can't afford to buy one.
                <br>We have helped upto 1 lakh female around Indian villages by providing them pads. We have our centres at almost 670 villages. Thousands of volunteer have joined us during our journey.
